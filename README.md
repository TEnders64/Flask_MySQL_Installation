# Flask_MySQL_Installation
The following list of procedures may help with Mac OS installations of the `mysql-python` package in your Flask_MySQL virtual environment

-----
|Error|Solution|
|---|---|
|Failed to build wheel for mysql-python| 1. Deactivate any virtual environments you have turned on.  We'll want to use Homebrew to help us install `mysql-connector-c`, but first we'll need to Update or Install XCode to use Homebrew 2. If you have XCode already installed, simply open XCode from your Launchpad or Applications and see if it prompts you to download updates 3. After installing/updating XCode, now we can do `brew install mysql-connector-c` from any directory in your terminal 4. If you get a warning saying that `mysql-connector-c is already installed but not linked`, jump to the next row of troubleshooting, otherwise continue. 5. Check that `mysql-connector-c` is in the list of installed packages using `brew list` 6. Turn your Flask+MySQL virtual environment back on. 7. `pip install mysql-python` 8. `pip install flask-sqlalchemy` 9. Do a `pip list` to make sure you see the sql-alchemy and mysql-python packages and away you go!|
|mysql-connector-c is already installed but not linked| This issue creeps up because you were successful at doing a brew install of mysql-connector-c earlier but it never made the links necessary to hook up with mysql.  We're going to follow brew's suggestions for linking it.  1. Attempt `brew link mysql-connector-c` and you'll get one of two outcomes.  One might be that there's no error or warning and in which case, you can continue from step 6 above (Nice!). The more likely case is that you get a warning that some links will need to be overwritten.  We'll need to run `brew link --overwrite mysql-connector-c` in that case.  You should get a response saying XXX number of symlinks created. Now you too can head back to step 6 above (You're almost there!)|
